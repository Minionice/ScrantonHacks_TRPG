Here, I will attempt to aggregate some of the ideas for the plot we discussed.

Our character, who will not be named immediately, begins in some unknown room (apparently, the scene is post-apocalyptic,
  but the user may not know that). The user must input text commands to progress through the game. The player begins the game seemingly
  in a strange facility, and the player escapes relatively quickly from a destroyed place. The player proceeds to enter a town and
  meets a number of new people. The player gradually completes quests and assists people in the town over time, building a reasonable
  reputation and making close friends. However, after some time, the game begins to act strangely, and the commands the user typically
  inputs to progress through the game no longer work correctly. Eventually, the entire dynamic of the user playing the game transforms
  as the player experiences more and more flashbacks, leading the player to struggle to maintain the friendships he or she made and keep
  calm psychologically (proported by the apparent "glitching" of the game). At last, the player returns to the place from which he or she came, only to discover some of the horrible acts
  he or she committed in the past. This leads to the question of whether the player can really hold the reputation he or she established
  and whether he or she has any capacity for good.
